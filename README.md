Hey! Welcome to the world of TerraformðŸ‘‹

This repo helps you to gain knowledge about Terraform as an IaC tool. I promise!

What you'd learn?

You'd learn what is Infrastructe As a Code (IaaC or IaC), what is terraform, and, why Terraform. How terraform is used to create infrastructure with the help of terraform file written in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) with a practical demonstration. You'll see creation of resources such as EC2, S3, IAM, VPC and more.

NOTE: This repo is still work in progres, more information on different concepts can be added in the future and I'm open to any suggestions/corrections if there are any.

Many thanks for visiting!
